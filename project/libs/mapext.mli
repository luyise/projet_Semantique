(** Association tables over ordered types.

    This module implements applicative association tables, also known as
    finite maps or dictionaries, given a total ordering function
    over the keys.
    All operations over maps are purely applicative (no side-effects).
    The implementation uses balanced binary trees, and therefore searching
    and insertion take time logarithmic in the size of the map.

    For instance:
    {[
      module IntPairs =
      struct
        type t = int * int
        let compare (x0,y0) (x1,y1) =
          match Pervasives.compare x0 x1 with
            0 -> Pervasives.compare y0 y1
          | c -> c
      end

      module PairsMap = Map.Make(IntPairs)

      let m = PairsMap.(empty |> add (0,1) "hello" |> add (1,0) "world")
    ]}

    This creates a new module [PairsMap], with a new type ['a PairsMap.t]
    of maps from [int * int] to ['a]. In this example, [m] contains [string]
    values so its type is [string PairsMap.t].

module type OrderedType =

  (** The type of the map keys. *)

  val compare : t -> t -> int
  (** A total ordering function over the keys.
      This is a two-argument function [f] such that
      [f e1 e2] is zero if the keys [e1] and [e2] are equal,
      [f e1 e2] is strictly negative if [e1] is smaller than [e2],
      and [f e1 e2] is strictly positive if [e1] is greater than [e2].
      Example: a suitable ordering function is the generic structural
      comparison function {!Pervasives.compare}. *)

      [m] is returned unchanged (the result of the function is

      [y] where [y] is [f (find_opt x m)], the binding of [x] is
      added, removed or updated. If [y] is [None], the binding is
      removed if it exists; otherwise, if [y] is [Some z] then [x]
      is associated to [z] in the resulting map.  If [x] was already
